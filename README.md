# Iban Validator Server - Clojure Demo

Goal of this project is to demonstrate that Clojure can be useful.
Mainly for me.

# Try It

In console run `lein ring server`

That should open a browser, and follow instructions there

# Thanks

Special thanks to my wife for patience;
colleagues from Yoursafe who shown me the Clojure;
and the Clojure community for welcoming me...
